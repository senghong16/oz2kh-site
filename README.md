# Oz2KH — Personal Shopper Website

This is a single‑page static site for the Australia → Cambodia personal shopper service.  
It embeds your live Google Form for pre‑orders.

## Files
- `index.html` — the website (open in a browser to preview)

## Quick Deploy to GitHub Pages (no code required)
1. Create a GitHub account if you don't have one: https://github.com
2. Click **New repository** → Name it **oz2kh-site** (or any name).
3. Choose **Public** → click **Create repository**.
4. On the repo page, click **Add file → Upload files**, then drag‑and‑drop `index.html` here.
5. Click **Commit changes**.
6. Enable Pages: **Settings → Pages → Build and deployment**  
   - **Source**: `Deploy from a branch`  
   - **Branch**: `main` (or `master`) / **folder**: `/ (root)` → **Save**
7. Wait for 1–3 minutes. Your site will be live at:  
   `https://<your-username>.github.io/oz2kh-site/`

## Optional: Use your own domain later
- Buy a domain (e.g., `oz2kh.com`), then in **Settings → Pages → Custom domain** enter `oz2kh.com` and follow DNS instructions (add a `CNAME` record to `<your-username>.github.io`).

## Edit the site
- Click the `index.html` file in GitHub, then **Edit (✏️)** → make changes → **Commit**.
- Pages will redeploy automatically.

## Troubleshooting
- If the page 404s, wait a few minutes or re‑save the Pages settings.
- Ensure your repo is **Public** for Pages.
- If the form doesn’t show, confirm the Google Form **embed** link is correct and public.
